                <p>Depending on the source of an image, the file could be quite large. A JPG from a professional DSLR camera, for example, could be dozens of megabytes. Depending on your needs, this could be too big. Compressing this image would be very useful.</p>
                <p>Likewise, you might have large images on your phone. These images could be taking up a lot of hard drive space and preventing you from taking more photos. Compressing them could free up more internal storage, fixing this problem.</p>
